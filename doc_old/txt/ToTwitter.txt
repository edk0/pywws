ToTwitter.py -- post a message to Twitter

   This module posts a brief message to Twitter. Account details are stored
   in the file weather.ini in your data directory. The only way to set these
   details is to edit the file. Run ToTwitter.py once to set the default
   values, which you can then change. Here is what you're likely to find when
   you edit weather.ini.

 [twitter]
 username = twitterusername
 password = twitterpassword

   The example template tweet.txt can be used to create your message. Note
   that the message will be truncated to 140 characters if it is too long.
