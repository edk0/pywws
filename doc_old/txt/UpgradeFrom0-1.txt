UpgradeFrom0-1.py -- converts v0.1 datastore to v0.3

   This program converts weather data from the format used by v0.1 of the
   Python weather station software to that used by v0.3. It is a good idea to
   back up your data before running UpgradeFrom0-1.py. After conversion to
   v0.3, use Reprocess.py to update the data from v0.3 to the current
   version.

   The program is very simple to use:

 python UpgradeFrom0-1.py data_directory
 python Reprocess.py data_directory

   where data_directory is the location of your stored data.
