DataStore.py -- stores readings in easy to access files

   This module is at the core of my weather station software. It stores data
   on disc, but without the overhead of a full scale database system. I have
   designed it to run on a small memory machine such as my Asus router. To
   minimise memory usage it only loads one day's worth of data at a time into
   memory.

   From a "user" point of view, the data is accessed as a cross between a
   list and a dictionary. Each data record is indexed by a datetime object
   (dictionary behaviour), but records are stored in order and can be
   accessed as slices (list behaviour).

   For example, to access the hourly data for last Christmas day, one might
   do the following:

 from datetime import datetime
 import DataStore
 hourly = DataStore.hourly_store('weather_data')
 for data in hourly[datetime(2008, 12, 25):datetime(2008, 12, 26)]:
     print data['idx'], data['temp_out']

   The module provides three classes to store different data. data_store
   takes "raw" data from the weather station, hourly_store, daily_store and
   monthly_store store processed data (see Process.py). All three are derived
   from the same core_store class, they only differ in the keys and types of
   data stored in each record.
