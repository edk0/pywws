TimeZone.py -- provide UTC and local tzinfo objects

   This module provides two datetime.tzinfo objects representing UTC and
   local time zones. These are used to convert timestamps to and from UTC and
   local time. The weather station software stores data with UTC timestamps,
   to avoid problems with daylight savings time, but the template and plot
   programs output data with local times.

   The module is copied directly from the datetime.tzinfo module
   documentation.
