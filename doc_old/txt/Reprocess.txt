Reprocess.py -- regenerates summary data

   This program recreates the hourly, daily and monthly summary data that is
   created by the Process.py program. It should be run whenever you upgrade
   to a newer version of pywws.

   The program is very simple to use:

 python Reprocess.py data_directory

   where data_directory is the location of your stored data.
