      <a href="auto/pywws.Localisation-module.html">Localisation.py</a> -- provides local language translations
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some of the pywws modules, such as <a href="WindRose.html">WindRose.py</a>, can automatically use your local language for such things as wind directions. The <a href="auto/pywws.Localisation-module.html">Localisation.py</a> module, mostly copied from examples in the Python documentation, enables this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before using pywws in your local language, you may need to write a translation file. Human languages have been given codes, such as 'en_GB' for British English or 'fr_CA' for Canadian French. To find out what language code you need, have a look at your computer's 'LANG' environment variable with this command:<br>
      <code>echo $LANG</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now have a look in the 'languages' directory in your pywws installation. If there is a .po file whose name matches the first two characters of your 'LANG' environment variable, then you don't need to do anything.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Creating a new translation
    </h3>
    <p>
      To create a new language file, first convert the supplied pywws.pot file to a template using the <code>create_template.sh</code> script. Change to the 'languages' subdirectory and run the script. This should create a suitable file, e.g. 'fr.po' on a French language system. Now edit the new .po file and translate all the 'msgstr' strings to your language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the language file can be used, it needs to be converted to a machine readable form. To do this, change back to the main pywws directory and type the following command:<br>
      <code>python setup.py build</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are satisfied with your translation effort, please send me a copy of the .po file to add to the pywws distribution.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Using a different language
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you want pywws to use a different language to that specified by your LANG environment variable, you can specify it in your weather.ini file. Choose a language for which a translation exists, for example 'en', then add it to your weather.ini file as follows:<br>
      <code>[config]<br>
      language = en</code>
