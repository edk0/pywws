      How to set up 'live' logging with pywws.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. Introduction.
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are two quite different modes of operation with pywws. Traditionally the Hourly.py program would be run at regular intervals (usually an hour) from <code>cron</code>. This is suitable for fairly static websites, but more frequent updates can be useful for sites such as Weather Underground (<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">http://www.wunderground.com/</a>). The newer LiveLog.py program runs continuously and can upload data every 48 seconds.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. Getting started.
    </h3>
    <p>
      First of all, you need to install pywws and make sure it can get data from your weather station. See <a href="HOWTO_get_started.html">HOWTO_get_started.html</a> for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try running LiveLog.py from the command line, with a high level of verbosity so you can see what's happening:
    </p>
<pre>
python LiveLog.py -vvv ~/weather/data
</pre>
    <p>
      Within 48 seconds you should see a 'live_data synchronised' message, and within the next five minutes (assuming you have set a 5 minute logging interval) you should see a 'live_data new ptr' message. Let LiveLog.py run for a few minutes longer, then kill the process by typing 'Ctrl+C'.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. Configuring periodic tasks.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Open your weather.ini file with a text editor. You should have a '[live]' section similar to the following:
    </p>
<pre>
[live]
underground = False
plot = []
text = []
twitter = []
</pre>
    <p>
      This section specifies what pywws should do every time it gets a new reading from the weather station, i.e. every 48 seconds. The 'underground' entry should be a boolean value (True or False) that enables 'Rapid Fire' uploads to Weather Underground. The 'plot' and 'text' entries are lists of template files for plots and text files to be uploaded to your web site, and the 'twitter' entry is a list of templates for messages to be posted to Twitter. You should probably leave all of theses lists blank.
    </p>
    <p>
	If you use YoWindow (<a href="http://yowindow.com/">http://yowindow.com/</a>) you can add an entry to the '[live]' section to specify your YoWindow file, e.g.:
    </p>
<pre>
[live]
yowindow = /home/jim/data/yowindow.xml
underground = False
...
</pre>
    <p>
      If you don't already have them, create four more sections in your weather.ini file: '[logged]', '[hourly]', '[12 hourly]' and '[daily]'. These sections should have the same entries as the '[live]' section, and specify what to do every time data is logged (5 to 30 minutes, depending on your logging interval), every hour, twice daily and once per day. Add the names of your template files to the appropriate entries, for example:
    </p>
<pre>
[logged]
underground = False
twitter = []
plot = []
text = []

[hourly]
underground = False
twitter = ['tweet.txt']
plot = ['7days.png.xml', '24hrs.png.xml', 'rose_12hrs.png.xml']
text = ['24hrs.txt', '6hrs.txt', '7days.txt']

[12 hourly]
underground = False
twitter = []
plot = []
text = []

[daily]
underground = False
twitter = []
plot = ['28days.png.xml']
text = ['allmonths.txt']
</pre>
    <p>
      If you enable 'underground' in any of these sections then all logged data since the previous upload will be uploaded, giving Weather Underground a full history. You don't need to do this if you have enabled 'live' uploading.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4. Run in the background.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In order to have LiveLog.py carry on running after you finish using your computer it needs to be run as a 'background job'. On most Linux / UNIX systems you can do this by putting an ampersand ('&amp;') at the end of the command line. For example:
    </p>
<pre>
python LiveLog.py ~/weather/data &amp;
</pre>
    <p>
      However, it would be useful to know what went wrong if the program crashes for any reason. LiveLog.py can store its messages in a log file, specified with the -l option:
    </p>
<pre>
python LiveLog.py -v -l ~/weather/data/pywws.log ~/weather/data &amp;
</pre>
    <h3>
      5. Automatic restarting.
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are various ways of configuring a Linux system to start a program when the machine boots up. Typically these involve putting a file in /etc/init.d/, which requires root priviledges. A slightly harder problem is ensuring a program restarts if it crashes. My solution to both problems is to run the following script from cron, every ten minutes.
    </p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

pidfile=/var/run/pywws.pid
datadir=/data/weather
logfile=$datadir/live_logger.log

# exit if process is running
[ -f $pidfile ] &amp;&amp; kill -0 `cat $pidfile` &amp;&amp; exit

# email last few lines of the logfile to see why it died
if [ -f $logfile ]; then
  log=/var/log/log-weather
  tail -40 $logfile &gt;$log
  /home/jim/scripts/email-log.sh $log "weather log"
  rm $log
  fi

# restart process
python /home/jim/weather/devel/LiveLog.py -v -l $logfile $datadir &amp;
echo $! &gt;$pidfile
</pre>
    <p>
      This stores the process id of the running LiveLog.py in <code>pidfile</code>. If the process is running, the script does nothing. If the process has crashed, it emails the last 40 lines of the log file to me (using a script that creates a message and passes it to <code>sendmail</code>) and then restarts LiveLog.py. You'll need to edit this quite a lot to suit your file locations and so on, but it gives some idea of what to do.
