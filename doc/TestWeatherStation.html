    <h2><a href="auto/TestWeatherStation.html">TestWeatherStation.py</a> -- test communication with weather station</h2>
    <p>
	This is a simple utility to test communication with the weather station. If this doesn't work, then there's a problem that needs to be sorted out before trying any of the other programs. Likely problems include not properly installing <a href="http://libusb.wiki.sourceforge.net/">libusb</a> or <a href="http://pyusb.berlios.de/">PyUSB</a>. Less likely problems include an incompatibility between libusb and some operating systems. The most unlikely problem is that you forgot to connect the weather station to your computer!
