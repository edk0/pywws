Introduction
============

Weather Underground is a USA based web site that gathers weather data
from stations around the world. This module enables pywws to upload
readings to Weather Underground.


Configuration
=============

If you haven't already done so, visit the Weather Underground web site
and create a member account for yourself. Then go to the 'Personal
Weather Stations' page and follow the 'new weather station' link. Fill
in all the required details, then click on 'submit'.

Copy your 'station ID' and password to a new ``[underground]`` section
in your ``weather.ini`` configuration file:

   [underground]
   password = secret
   station = ABCDEFG1A

Remember to stop all pywws software before editing ``weather.ini``.

Test your configuration by running ``ToUnderground.py`` (replace
``data_dir`` with your weather data directory):

   python pywws/ToUnderground.py -vvv data_dir

This should show you the data string that is uploaded and then a
'success' message.


Upload old data
===============

Now you can upload your last 7 days' data. Edit your ``weather.ini``
file and remove the ``last update`` line from the ``[underground]``
section, then run ``ToUnderground.py`` with the catchup option:

   python pywws/ToUnderground.py -c -v data_dir

This may take 20 minutes or more, depending on how much data you have.


Add Weather Underground upload to regular tasks
===============================================

Edit your ``weather.ini`` again, and add ``underground = True`` to the
``[live]``, ``[logged]``, ``[hourly]``, ``[12 hourly]`` or ``[daily]``
section, depending on how often you want to send data. For example:

   [live]
   underground = True
   twitter = []
   plot = []
   text = []

If you set ``underground = True`` in the ``live`` section, pywws will
use Weather Underground's 'Rapid Fire' mode to send a reading every 48
seconds.

Restart your regular pywws program (``Hourly.py`` or ``LiveLog.py``)
and visit the Weather Underground web site to see regular updates from
your weather station.
