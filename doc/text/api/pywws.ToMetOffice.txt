Introduction
============

The UK Met Office has recently introduced WOW - Weather Observations
Website. This can accept readings from automatic weather stations, in
a very similar way to Weather Underground. This module enables pywws
to upload readings to WOW.


Configuration
=============

If you haven't already done so, visit the Met Office WOW web site and
create a user account for yourself. Then go to the 'Sites' page and
follow the 'create new site' link. Fill in all the required details,
including the 'AWS 6-digit PIN'. Note that the 'reporting hours'
should be set to option C, regardless of your 'day end hour' setting.

Copy your 'site ID' and 'AWS PIN' from the Met Office web site to a
new ``[metoffice]`` section in your ``weather.ini`` configuration
file:

   [metoffice]
   site id = 12345678
   aws pin = 654321

Remember to stop all pywws software before editing ``weather.ini``.

Test your configuration by running ``ToMetOffice.py`` (replace
``data_dir`` with your weather data directory):

   python pywws/ToMetOffice.py -vvv data_dir

This should show you the data string that is uploaded, and no other
messages.


Upload old data
===============

Now you can upload your last 7 days' data. Edit your ``weather.ini``
file and remove the ``last update`` line from the ``[metoffice]``
section, then run ``ToMetOffice.py`` with the catchup option:

   python pywws/ToMetOffice.py -c -v data_dir

This may take 20 minutes or more, depending on how much data you have.


Add Met Office upload to regular tasks
======================================

Edit your ``weather.ini`` again, and add ``metoffice = True`` to the
``[logged]``, ``[hourly]``, ``[12 hourly]`` or ``[daily]`` section,
depending on how often you want to send data. For example:

   [logged]
   plot = []
   text = []
   twitter = []
   underground = False
   metoffice = True

Restart your regular pywws program (``Hourly.py`` or ``LiveLog.py``)
and visit the Met Office WOW web site to see regular updates from your
weather station.


Acknowledgment
==============
