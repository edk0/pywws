      <a href="auto/Localisation.html">Localisation.py</a> -- provides local language translations
    </h2>
    <p>
	Some of the pywws modules, such as <a href="WindRose.html">WindRose.py</a>, can automatically use your local language for such things as wind directions. The <a href="auto/Localisation.html">Localisation.py</a> module, mostly copied from examples in the Python documentation, enables this.
    </p>
    <p>
	Before using pywws in your local language, you may need to write a translation file. Human languages have been given codes, such as 'en_GB' for British English or 'fr_CA' for Canadian French. To find out what language code you need, have a look at your computer's 'LANG' environment variable with this command:<br><code>echo $LANG</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
	Now have a look in the 'languages' directory in your pywws installation. If there is a .po file whose name matches the first two characters of your 'LANG' environment variable, then you don't need to do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
	To create a new language file, first copy the supplied pywws.pot file. For example, to create a French translation you would copy pywws.pot to fr.po. Now edit your new .po file (fr.po) and fill in the double quotes on all the 'msgstr' lines with translations of the 'msgid' line immediately above. You should also set the data at the top of the file with your name, email address, language, character set and date/time.
    </p>
    <p>
	Before the language file can be used, it needs to be converted to a machine readable form. To do this, type the following command:<br><code>python setup.py build</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
	When you are satisfied with your translation effort, please send me a copy of the .po file to add to the pywws distribution.
