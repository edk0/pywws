                Python software for USB Wireless WeatherStations

Index

   This software collection contains the following text files and pure Python
   modules / programs.

     * README.txt -- getting started instructions
     * CHANGELOG.txt -- development history
     * LICENCE.txt -- GNU General Public License
     * weather.ini -- configuration file format
     * WeatherStation.py -- gets data from the weather station
     * TestWeatherStation.py -- test communication with weather station
     * DataStore.py -- stores readings in easy to access files
     * LogData.py -- saves recent readings to file
     * Localisation.py -- provides local language translations
     * Hourly.py -- run from cron
     * Process.py -- summarises raw data
     * Plot.py -- plots weather data using an XML recipe
     * WindRose.py -- draw a "wind rose" using an XML recipe
     * Template.py -- creates text data file based on a template
     * Upload.py -- uploads files to a web site by ftp
     * ToTwitter.py -- post a message to Twitter
     * EWtoPy.py -- converts EasyWeather.dat to DataStore format
     * UpgradeFrom0-1.py -- converts v0.1 datastore to later versions
     * Reprocess.py -- regenerates hourly and daily summary data
     * TimeZone.py -- provide UTC and local tzinfo objects
     * AutoDoc.py -- creates detailed documentation of each module

   More detail about the individual modules can be found by following the
   above links. This documentation is not comprehensive, I merely attempt to
   describe some of the software's more unusual features.

Using the software

   I have written this software to meet my needs, but have tried to make it
   adaptable to other people's requirements. You may want to edit some or all
   of the modules, or write some new ones, to get it to do exactly what you
   want. One of the reasons for using Python is that it makes such
   alterations so easy. Don't be afraid, just jump in and have a go. You'll
   probably want to change Hourly.py first.
