EWtoPy.py -- converts EasyWeather.dat to DataStore format

   This program converts data from the format used by the EasyWeather program
   supplied with the weather station to the format used by this Python
   software. It is useful if you've been using EasyWeather for a while before
   discovering this software.

   The EasyWeather.dat file is only used to provide data from before the
   start of the pywws data. As your weather station has its own memory, you
   should run LogData.py before EWtoPy.py to minimise use of the
   EasyWeather.dat file.

   EWtoPy.py converts the time stamps in EasyWeather.dat from local time to
   UTC. This can cause problems when daylight savings time ends, as local
   time appears to jump back one hour. The program attempts to detect this
   and correct the affected time stamps, but I have not been able to test
   this on a variety of time zones.
