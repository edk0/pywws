TestWeatherStation.py -- test communication with weather station

   This is a simple utility to test communication with the weather station.
   If this doesn't work, then there's a problem that needs to be sorted out
   before trying any of the other programs. Likely problems include not
   properly installing libusb or PyUSB. Less likely problems include an
   incompatibility between libusb and some operating systems. The most
   unlikely problem is that you forgot to connect the weather station to your
   computer!
